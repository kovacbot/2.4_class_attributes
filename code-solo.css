/* 1. Yeck, the image is way too big. Go to line 20 in your code-solo.html file and give the img tag a class. Remember that the class name should describe the HTML element */

/* 2. Select the image's class name and adjust the width to a reasonable size. Don't forget the dot before the class name! */


/* 3. Still using the image's class name selector, give the image a border radius (border-radius) of 7px */

/* 4. Select the body tag and change: the background color (background-color) to your favorite color and the font color (color) to one that works well with the background. */


/* 5. Change the color for the paragraph tags to whatever color you like (should be different from the body color). */


/* 6. Spicy Task (extra credit): see if you can align the h1 header to the center of the page. */


/* 7. Once you are finished, take a screenshot of your code and website and attach it to the assignment on 2.3 Code Solo assignment on Google classroom. */
